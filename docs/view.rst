Projecting Data
===============

pycortex has two main methods for projecting functional data onto flatmaps. There is also an older, deprecated viewer found in mixer.py that is based on mayavi. However, several bugs in mayavi prevent full integration, and support for this mayavi version was dropped in the early days.
